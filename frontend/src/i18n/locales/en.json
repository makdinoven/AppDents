You’ll also receive a receipt and enrollment confirmation via email, ensuring you have everything you need to get started. If you don’t see the email in your inbox, please check your spam folder (and any other mail folders—the sender’s name is “no-reply”). Your course materials will be available instantly, allowing you to learn at your own pace from any device.",
